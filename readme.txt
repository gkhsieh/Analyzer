The Python programs grab data from the Riot Games API in a JSON file. We chose Python for this task since it is much simpler simple to parse a JSON file in Python.

APIGrabber takes the output from the Java program in input.txt, obtains information from the API, and passes it back to the Java program in output.txt.

=====IMPORTANT======
This project requires a new API key every 24 hours.
This is located on line 33 in the APIGrabber.py on the line APIKey = "[API-KEY]"
